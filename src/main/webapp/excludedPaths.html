Paths to exclude from monitoring refer to the path names, which are disregarded when SCM is polled to
 trigger a build as result of changes.

Wildcards like '?', '*' and '**' could be used to specify path patterns. If you specify a path as **/*, then all the contents of the
project/stream will be ignored. Folder name doesn't include all the subfolders implicitly.
