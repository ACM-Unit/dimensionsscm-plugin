Setting this option will mean that successful or unstable builds will be
<i>tagged</i> in Dimensions as a baseline. You will then have a Dimensions
baseline representing the built source to refer to in the future.
<p>
The baseline that gets created has a name of
<blockquote>[PROJECTID]_[JENKINS_PROJECT]_[BUILDNO]</blockquote>
by default, where
<dl>
    <dt>[PROJECTID]</dt>
    <dd>is the name of the Dimensions stream or project being monitored.</dd>
    <dt>[JENKINS_PROJECT]</dt>
    <dd>is the name of the Jenkins project</dd>
    <dt>[BUILDNO]</dt>
    <dd>is the Jenkins build number</dd>
</dl>
If a baseline name pattern is specified (in Advanced...) then the baseline that
is created will reflect that baseline name pattern.
<p>
(<i>Note</i>: The resulting baseline name must comply with restrictions on
Dimensions baseline names. For example, if the baseline name includes the
Jenkins project name, then that Jenkins project name may not include the colon
character).
