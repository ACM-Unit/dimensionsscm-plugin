# Changelog

### 0.8.19

-   _Released: Apr 6, 2021_
-   Bugfix: tables-to-div-regression - Jenkins v2.264+ (so Jenkins LTS
    v2.277+) introduced a new form renderer which broke system and job
    configuration forms if Dimensions plugin was installed
    (JENKINS-65266)
-   Enhancement: The oldest version of Jenkins supported by the
    Dimensions plugin has been moved up to Jenkins LTS v2.222+.
    If you're still using an older version of Jenkins, then there's
    no reason to upgrade to this version of the Dimensions plugin
    yet anyway

### 0.8.18

-   _Released: Feb 25, 2020_
-   Bugfix: Fix for pipelines run on remote agents

### 0.8.17

-   _Released: Jan 17, 2020_
-   Bugfix: Fixed polling mechanism and change log view issues
-   Enhancement: Implemented credential plugin support. Now you can
    choose login/password from the list of credentials
-   Enhancement: Implemented pipeline support for Dimensions SCM
-   Enhancement: Improved the change log view

### 0.8.16

-   _Released: Nov 19, 2018_
-   Bugfix: Baseline names generated using `[CURRENT_DATE]`Â were no
    longer legal in Dimensions CM 14.4, so changed colon separators to
    period characters. If you rely on the format of the baseline name
    including these (now invalid) colon characters you can revert to the
    old behavior by setting a system property (L3R08939)

### 0.8.15

-   _Released: Sep 13, 2018_
-   Bugfix: Passwords were stored in configuration files with a
    straightforward reversible encoding - it is now encrypted with
    Jenkins' own encryption (SECURITY-1065)
-   Bugfix: The validation on the configuration form was vulnerable to
    CSRF and didn't check Jenkins permissions appropriately
    (SECURITY-1108)
-   *Important Security Note: Upgrading to this version of the plugin,
    in order to get both of these security fixes, is recommended for
    all users*

### 0.8.14

-   _Released: May 3, 2018_
-   Enhancement: Implemented small number of more recent SCM methods to
    improve compatibility with other Jenkins plugins (JENKINS-44583)
-   Enhancement: Added MIT-licensed source for stub version of the Java
    API, so Jenkins.io CI infrastructure can be used (also plugin code
    is now licensed with simple standard MIT license)
-   Bugfix: Post-build baseline operations should change the build state
    (JENKINS-32268)
-   Bugfix: Minor UI changes to make default repository behavior more
    understandable
-   Bugfix: Users without privilege to fetch request detailed
    descriptions can run request-based builds (JENKINS-48645)

### 0.8.13

-   _Released: Jan 26, 2016_
-   Enhancement: Improved diagnostics for missing JARs and for various
    error conditions involving slaves (IOExceptions or inability to
    locate dmcli)

### 0.8.12

-   _Released: May 14, 2015_
-   Bugfix: *Check Connection* button (in Configure pages) could fail to
    connect with a `NullPointerException` in some environments
-   Enhancement: Reduced warnings in the System Log by not calling
    deprecated Jenkins APIs and better diagnostic messages when things
    go wrong
-   Enhancement: Improved handling of non-ASCII filenames in changelogs

### 0.8.11

-   _Released: Mar 25, 2015_
-   Bugfix: Reconfiguring a job to use Ant patterns for the upload
    artifacts post-build action failed in Jenkins 1.596 and later (no
    need for this update unless you have this issue)

### 0.8.10

-   _Released: Mar 23, 2015_
-   Bugfix: Regular expression pattern-matching for upload of build
    artifacts was no longer using the full workspace-relative path, but
    just the filename component of the path; the full workspace-relative
    path is now used again
-   Enhancement: The plugin now uses the Jenkins System log for
    debug-logging, and the logging and build output should include
    better detail about the reasons for any problem than in previous
    releases

### 0.8.9

-   _Released: Dec 10, 2014_
-   Enhancement: Can exclude file path patterns from being monitored for
    changes (for example, useful for built artifacts). Changes to
    excluded file patterns won't trigger a build, but will still be
    shown and updated when a build is eventually started by some
    subsequent change. The patterns to exclude are Ant-style patterns
    using `/` as a separator (even on Windows). For example,
    `**/target/**` would ignore changes in any `target` directory in the
    repository, and `**/*.class` would ignore changes to any `.class`
    files in the repository

### 0.8.8

-   _Released: Oct 29, 2014_
-   Bugfix: Using check out and then check in on projects could lead to
    missed modifications during polling in particular circumstances
-   Bugfix: It was possible for unwanted content to appear in
    config.xml; this should no longer occur

### 0.8.6

-   _Released: Jan 31, 2014_
-   Enhancement: Checking in artifacts now supports exclusion patterns
    as well as inclusion patterns

### 0.8.5

-   _Released: Dec 25, 2013_
-   Enhancement: Checking in artifacts now supports filtering by
    Ant-style patterns as well as regular expressions
-   *Warning: Upgrading to this version means you will have to
    reconfigure any job which uses the check in artifact functionality.
    Failure to do so will end up with the checkin either failing or
    being ignored*

    the GUI implied the other order.
